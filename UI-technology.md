# Swing

## A brief description of the technology
Swing is a framework in Java that creates user interfaces. Since it is based on the Java language, it is object oriented. It contains various classes that extend one another, and the notion of extending a base class to add required functionality to that class is key to user interface programming in Java. Another key part of Swing programming is the notion of listeners: classes or components that "listen out for" a particular event happening such as a button being clicked. And listeners are generally implemented as Java interfaces.

## Reason(s) why this technology is an appropriate possibility for this project
* provides a graphical user interface that works on all operating systems
* it is object oriented
* it is easy to implement
* provides a nice interface

# AWT

## A brief description of the technology
Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) is a well known Java framework for creating graphical user interfaces.

## Reason(s) why this technology is an appropriate possibility for this project
* well documented and tested
* familiar to many students/maintainers
* relatively easy to learn
* implemented using the Java language (which is the language used in this project)

AWT is a part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes, which makes it a trusted choice for creating graphical user interfaces. Because it's backed by Oracle, there is adequate documentation for maintainers to reference.
